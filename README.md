As a LEGO enthusiast I wanted to create something that the community could use
to build out track layouts; Both from scratch and with the help of AI.

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

2. Start the development server

   ```bash
   pnpm dev
   ```

   Open the URL printed in the terminal to view the editor.

Use <kbd>H</kbd> to toggle the HUD and open the Auto Layout modal from the
toolbar to generate layouts automatically.

Current features:
- Add straight and curve pieces to create a layout
- Delete individual track pieces
- Clear all pieces
- Rotate pieces
- Flip pieces
- Ghost piece to see the placement and orientation
- Undo track placement
- Copy your track schema
- Paste your track schema
- Auto layout - enter number of straight and curved pieces in your collection and see what layout is possible
- Keyboard shortcuts
- Toggle HUD with <kbd>H</kbd>

Upcoming features:
- Add more track pieces
- Improve track look
- Improve placing curve pieces
