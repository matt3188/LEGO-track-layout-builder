# LEGO track layout builder

🏗️ Work in progress 🚧

As a LEGO enthusiast I wanted to create something that the community could use
to build out track layouts; Both from scratch and with the help of AI.


Scope of work for an MVP will be:
- Select and place straight and curved track to form a complete layout
- Export a list of parts and there count in order to build the layout
