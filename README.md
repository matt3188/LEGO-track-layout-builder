🏗️ Work in progress 🚧
https://matt3188.github.io/LEGO-track-layout-builder/

As a LEGO enthusiast I wanted to create something that the community could use
to build out track layouts; Both from scratch and with the help of AI.

Current features:
- Add straight and curve pieces to create a layout
- Delete individual track pieces
- Clear all pieces
- Rotate pieces
- Flip pieces
- Ghost piece to see the placement and orientation
- Undo track placement
- Save your track layout and load it later
- Auto layout - enter number of straight and curved pieces in your collection and see what layout is possible
- Keyboard shortcuts
- Toggle HUD with <kbd>H</kbd>

Upcoming features:
- Add more track pieces
- Improve track look
- Improve placing curve pieces

Feature request - please raise an [issue](https://github.com/matt3188/LEGO-track-layout-builder/issues/new) and add the 'enhancement' label
